    - experiments with manual focus, does not seem to be possible with the
      Nikon, still investigating, but see email:

      http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=gphoto-user&max_rows=25&style=nested&viewmonth=201110&viewday=13

    - added a 'Focus' button to trigger the camera's own autofocus, just a
      shortcut for the control in the preferences panel
    - lights hop automatically after 10s of inactivity (was 30s)
    - don't overwrite on capture
